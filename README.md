## Getting Started

These instructions will help you set up and run nightfall on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following software installed on your system:

1. [nix](https://nixos.org/download.html) (version 2.15.0 or later)

### Examples

Examples of programs described in the eDSL can be found in [the Examples folder](./src/Examples/).

### Usage

For now, the [Main](./app/Main.hs) is simply a dummy program to test the [examples](./src/Examples/). Launch with
```sh
cabal run nightfall -- <example-name>
```

to get the MASM output on stdin, or

```sh
cabal run nightfall -- <example-name> <filepath>
```

You can then run the generated miden programs with

```sh
miden run -a <path-to-your-generated-masm-file>
```

to save the MASM output on file (warning: override).

This will obviosuly disappear when the library gets more mature.

*Note*: this is first draft / alpha / experimental / subject to breaking changed even in the same day!
Types aren't safe, "smart constructors" aren't "smart". This is just to kickstart the project
